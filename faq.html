<summary>What was Grant Show's role in Melrose Place?</summary>
<p>Grant Show played Jake Hanson, one of the central characters in Melrose Place, appearing in all 227 episodes from 1992 to 1997. Jake was portrayed as a motorcycle-riding carpenter who owned and managed the apartment complex where the show's characters lived. The character was written as the romantic, brooding male lead with a troubled past and complicated relationships, particularly with Amanda Woodward (played by Heather Locklear) and Alison Parker (played by Courtney Thorne-Smith). Jake's character arc included running a bar called Shooters, various business ventures, and multiple romantic entanglements that drove much of the show's drama. The role made Show a recognizable figure in 1990s pop culture and established him as a leading man in primetime television. His performance helped define the archetype of the damaged-but-noble male lead that became common in subsequent television dramas.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How does Grant Show's Blake Carrington compare to the original?</summary>
<p>Grant Show's interpretation of Blake Carrington in The CW's Dynasty reboot (2017-2022) differed significantly from John Forsythe's portrayal in the original series (1981-1989). While Forsythe played Blake as an older, established patriarch in his 50s and 60s, Show brought a more physically imposing and contemporary edge to the role, portraying a modern billionaire dealing with current business challenges like renewable energy and tech disruption. Show's Blake maintained the character's ruthlessness and family devotion but added layers of vulnerability and moral complexity suited to 2010s-2020s television storytelling. The reboot also placed Blake in different narrative contexts, including more diverse family dynamics and contemporary social issues. Show appeared in all 108 episodes of the reboot compared to Forsythe's 217 episodes of the original. Both actors successfully anchored their respective versions, but Show's performance reflected modern anti-hero trends in television where protagonists display more morally ambiguous characteristics.</p>
